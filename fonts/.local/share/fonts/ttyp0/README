INTRODUCTION

This archive contains the source code and auxiliary programs for

UW ttyp0 is a family of monospaced bitmap fonts in bdf format. It covers
most of the Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian, Georgian (only
Mkhedruli), Hebrew (without cantillation marks), Thai, most of IPA (but
no UPA), standard punctuation, common symbols, some mathematics, line
graphics and a few dingbats (about 3000 Unicode characters).

UW ttyp0 comes in nine sizes (6x11, 6x12, 7x13, 7x14, 8x15, 8x16, 9x17,
9x18, 11x22). In all of the sizes there are regular and bold versions;
